                        Rome, Italian Roma, historic city and capital of Roma provincia (province),
                        of Lazio regione (region), and of the country of Italy. Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian
                        peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Once the capital of an
                        ancient republic and empire whose armies
                        and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical
                        seat of the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic
                        and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, and a memorial to the
                        creative imagination of the past.

                <p >
                    Originally spoken by small groups of people living along the lower Tiber River, Latin spread with
                    the increase of Roman political power, first throughout Italy and then throughout most of western
                    and southern Europe and the central and western Mediterranean coastal regions of Africa.
                    I am interested in Latin language because it provides a key to the Romance languages, Spanish,
                    French,
                    <!-- Italian, Portuguese etc. Latin is the universal language of western civilization. Actually,
                    Latin provides the blueprint for any language we may be learning later in life: German, Russian,
                    Chinese, or any other one. -->

                    <p>The District Museum existed as a peripatetic movement between 1989 and 1994, building support for
                        the work of memory through creating collecting points and storytelling opportunities in different parts of
                        the city. The diaspora of District Sixers played an important role in shaping and contributing to the Museum’s
                        exhibition and programme, and they continue to be pivotal to the ongoing work of memory and holistic
                        restitution. Their desire to return and re-member is ever present in this work.</p>

                    <p>The Castle of Good Hope was built between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is known as the oldest
                        surviving building in South Africa and has been the centre of civilian, political and military life at the
                        Cape from approximately 1679. In its current state, the Castle arguably represents one of the best
                        preserved 17th century DEIC architecture on the entire globe.
                        The 2015 – 2016 renovation of the Castle – the first in 20 years – will further enhance its
                        appeal and position it well to become South Africa’s next UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

                    <p>Cape Towns City Hall's original foundations were laid at the turn of the 20th Century. The mayor
                        of Cape Town, Thomas Ball,
                        laid the corner stone of the City Hall on 29 August 1900, but the hall was only opened in 1905.
                        It was designed by architects Reid
                        and Green from Johannesburg and was built in Italian Renaissance style, one of the last major
                        Victorian buildings to be erected in Cape Town.
                        It was built from sand stone and has 39 bells making it one of the largest carillons in South
                        Africa.</p>
